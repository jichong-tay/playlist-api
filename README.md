# Playlist Backend Server
-------------------------
Capstone Project of a Backend Go Server.


### Food Subscriptions
To help our users avoid the hassle of deciding what food to order, we want to create a Food Playlist!
We need a beautify UI where users can input food preferences, and based on such preferences generate a ""playlist"" of food deliveries.
For example, a user might want to eat halal Hamburgers, and the user wants a hamburger delivered every Thursday at 2pm.
The system would then generate a ""playlist"" of different hamburger dishes from various restaurants such that each Thursday at 2pm the user receives a hamburger without any intervention.
The user should be able to pause the playlist if they are traveling etc.
